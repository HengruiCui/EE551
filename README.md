## Five in a row
Five in a Row is an abstract strategy board game and is also called Gomoku, Gobang. It is traditionally played with go pieces (black and white stones) on a go board. However, once placed, pieces are not moved or removed from the board.
Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
I use tkinter to make a cheeseboard like this:

Then I make a algorithm to complete the game.
I will make a "Person vs Person" game first because it is easier than setting AI, which will refer to the knowledge of machine learning. If I have more time, I will try to set AI to challenge myself.
