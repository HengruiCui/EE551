## Five in a row
### Introduction
Five in a Row is an abstract strategy board game and is also called Gomoku, Gobang. It is traditionally played with go pieces (black and white stones) on a go board. However, once placed, pieces are not moved or removed from the board.<BR/>
<BR/>
### Rules
Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<BR/>

### tkinter
Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk.Tkinter is not the only GuiProgramming toolkit for Python. It is however the most commonly used one. I use tkinter to make a cheeseboard like this:

Then I make a algorithm to complete the game.<BR/>

### Basic function
I will make a "Person vs Person" game first because it is easier than setting AI. I can use algorithm to complete the game and it can be easy to realize the function that two people play the game together.
### Advanced function
If I have enough time, I want to challenge myself to set AI. I will use the knowledge of machine learning to train AI, so that it can play with players through studying by itself.
