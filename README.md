## Five in a row
### Introduction
Five in a Row is an abstract strategy board game and is also called Gomoku, Gobang. It is traditionally played with go pieces (black and white stones) on a go board. However, once placed, pieces are not moved or removed from the board.<BR/>
<BR/>
### Rules
Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<BR/>

### package
Use graphics package and getMouse function to realize the function of the game. I use graphics to make a cheeseboard like this:
![example](https://github.com/HengruiCui/EE551/blob/master/cheese.png)<BR/>
Then I make a algorithm to complete the game.<BR/>

### Advanced function
If I have enough time, I want to challenge myself to set AI. I will use the knowledge of machine learning to train AI, so that it can play with players through studying by itself.
